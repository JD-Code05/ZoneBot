# YouTube Channel Assistant Bot 🤖

This is a personal Discord bot built with Python to help manage a YouTube channel. It uses `discord.py` to connect to Discord, `yt-dlp` for video downloading, and the `google-api-python-client` to interact with the YouTube Data API v3.



## ✨ Features

* **Video Downloader:** Download any YouTube video (especially Shorts) directly into a Discord channel.
* **Channel Stats:** Fetch and display current subscriber, view, and video counts for your channel.
* **Upload Notifier:** Automatically checks your YouTube channel every 5 minutes and posts an alert in a specific Discord channel when a new video is uploaded.
